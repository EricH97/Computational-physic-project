# Computational-physics-project
This repository contains my Matlab code files that were used to obtain the results of my simulations.
The code can be used to simulate a system consisting of two charged and conducting spheres whose mutual interaction renders the surface charge density non-uniform. 

The file CompPhysProject.m is a script that can be ran to obtain the same figures as in my report.
The file forceFromImages.m is a function that computes the force between the spheres based on the method of images.
The file force.m is a function that computes the force between the spheres by using the variational method.
The file LP.m is a function used to evaluate the Legendre polynomials N<=10.
The file GaussLegendre.m finds the nodes and weights of Gauss quadrature by using the Golub-Welsch algorithm.
The file potEnergy.m evaluates the potential energy of the spheres
The file potential2.m computes the potential inside and outside the spheres by using Legendre polynomials.
